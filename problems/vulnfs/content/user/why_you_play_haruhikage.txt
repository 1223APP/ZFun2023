Thank you for being willing to see me today. I'm sorry, I really wanted to apologize to you face to face. We really didn't plan to play Haruhikage that day. We only planned to play one song that day. I didn't want to play it either. But the performance had started and I had no choice. I'm sorry, this must have hurt you a lot. You don't have to forgive us, it's only natural. After all, we played an important song that belongs to us without permission. I'm really sorry. Why do you want me to forget? We used to have such a good relationship. We were all happy together every day. But now we are all going our separate ways. This is too strange. Didn't you say that the band is a community of fate? Please, I want to start crychic again. I want to find back the happy days we had. crychic is not over. I have been working hard for it. Wait, don't go. I really like you all and value you all. Pleaaaaaaase, what can I do to make you come back? I can do anything for you. I really do T.T
